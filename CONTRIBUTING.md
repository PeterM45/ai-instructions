# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project collects AI coding instructions and best practices for popular frameworks, programming languages, and development tools.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### Adding a New Technology

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create your instruction file** following this structure:

```
instructions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technology-name/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai.md             # Main AI instructions file
```

3. **Add your technology to the list**

   - Open `public/data/technology-list.json`
   - Add an object for your technology to the `technologies` array, for example:

```json
{
  "id": "your-tech",
  "type": "Framework|Language|Runtime|Styling|Tool|Other",
  "contributors": ["your-github-username"],
  "resources": ["https://link-to-resource.com"],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-07-20",
  "isVerified": false
}
```

> **Note:** If you add more than 4 contributors or resources, only the first 4 will be shown on the card by default. A "+N more" button will appear to expand the full list. This keeps the UI clean and readable.

4. **No manual logo upload needed!**

   - The app will automatically generate the logo and environment name using [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and your directory name. If your technology is not found in Simple Icons, a fallback icon will be shown.

5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description. We'll review and merge your contribution!

## üìù Guidelines

### Content Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Provide clear, actionable AI instructions
- **Focus on AI context**: Instructions should help AI understand the technology's patterns, best practices, and conventions
- **Include examples**: Show practical code examples and patterns
- **Keep it current**: Ensure instructions work with recent versions
- **Be concise**: AI instructions should be comprehensive but not overly verbose

### Technology Types

- **Framework**: React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, FastAPI, Django, etc.
- **Language**: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, etc.
- **Runtime**: Node.js, Deno, Bun, etc.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, styled-components, CSS Modules, etc.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- **Cloud Service**: AWS, Azure, GCP specific instructions
- **Tool**: Webpack, Vite, ESLint, Prettier, etc.
- **Other**: Everything else

### File Structure

- **Use kebab-case** for directory names: `my-technology`
- **Main instruction file** must be named `ai.md`
- **Keep it simple** - only the AI instructions file is needed

### Logo Requirements

- **High quality**: Vector (SVG) preferred, or high-res PNG (min 64x64px)
- **Public access**: Must be accessible via HTTPS without authentication
- **Appropriate licensing**: Ensure you have rights to use the logo
- **Good contrast**: Logos should work well on dark backgrounds

## üéØ AI Instructions Best Practices

Your `ai.md` file should include:

1. **Technology Overview**: Brief description and current version
2. **Best Practices**: Coding patterns, naming conventions, project structure
3. **Common Patterns**: Frequently used code snippets and approaches
4. **Performance Tips**: Optimization techniques and anti-patterns to avoid
5. **Integration Notes**: How it works with other tools and frameworks
6. **Examples**: Real-world code examples demonstrating proper usage

### Example Structure for `ai.md`:

````markdown

## üîç Review Process

1. **Automatic checks**: PR will be validated for JSON syntax and required fields
2. **Manual review**: Maintainers will review content quality and accuracy
3. **Testing**: Instructions will be tested with popular AI tools
4. **Feedback**: You may receive requests for improvements
