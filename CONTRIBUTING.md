# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project collects AI coding instructions and best practices for popular frameworks, programming languages, and development tools.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### Adding a New Technology

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create instruction files** following this structure:

```
instructions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technology-name/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Overview and setup info
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai.md             # Main AI instructions file
```

3. **Add a technology logo** (recommended size: 64x64px or SVG)

   - Use reliable CDNs like GitHub's raw content, official websites, or jsDelivr
   - Ensure the logo is publicly accessible and has good contrast

4. **Update `public/data/prompts.json`** with your technology:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-kebab-case-id",
  "environment": "Technology Name",
  "type": "Framework|Language|Runtime|Styling|Database|Cloud Service|Tool|Other",
  "rulesFile": "ai.md",
  "installationInstructions": "Copy to your AI configuration file",
  "description": "Clear, concise description (keep under 80 characters)",
  "logo": "https://example.com/path/to/logo.png",
  "logoAlt": "Technology Name Logo",
  "link": "https://github.com/PeterM45/ai-instructions/blob/main/instructions/technology-name/ai.md",
  "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "contributors": ["your-github-username"]
}
```

5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## üìù Guidelines

### Content Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Provide clear, actionable AI instructions
- **Focus on AI context**: Instructions should help AI understand the technology's patterns, best practices, and conventions
- **Include examples**: Show practical code examples and patterns
- **Keep it current**: Ensure instructions work with recent versions
- **Be concise**: AI instructions should be comprehensive but not overly verbose

### Technology Types

- **Framework**: React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, FastAPI, Django, etc.
- **Language**: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C#, etc.
- **Runtime**: Node.js, Deno, Bun, etc.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, styled-components, CSS Modules, etc.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
- **Cloud Service**: AWS, Azure, GCP specific instructions
- **Tool**: Webpack, Vite, ESLint, Prettier, etc.
- **Other**: Everything else

### File Structure

- **Use kebab-case** for directory names: `my-technology`
- **Main instruction file** must be named `ai.md`
- **Include a README.md** with technology overview and setup instructions

### Logo Requirements

- **High quality**: Vector (SVG) preferred, or high-res PNG (min 64x64px)
- **Public access**: Must be accessible via HTTPS without authentication
- **Appropriate licensing**: Ensure you have rights to use the logo
- **Good contrast**: Logos should work well on dark backgrounds

## üéØ AI Instructions Best Practices

Your `ai.md` file should include:

1. **Technology Overview**: Brief description and current version
2. **Best Practices**: Coding patterns, naming conventions, project structure
3. **Common Patterns**: Frequently used code snippets and approaches
4. **Performance Tips**: Optimization techniques and anti-patterns to avoid
5. **Integration Notes**: How it works with other tools and frameworks
6. **Examples**: Real-world code examples demonstrating proper usage

### Example Structure for `ai.md`:

````markdown
